Feature:  Login Screen
  In order to ensure the security of critical business and customer data
  As a developer of the TestCentricity Mobile gem
  I expect users to access the app only with valid login credentials


  Background:
    Given I have launched the SauceLabs My Demo app
    And I am on the Login screen


  Scenario Outline:  Verify correct error states when using invalid credentials
    When I enter user credentials with <reason>
    Then I expect an error to be displayed due to <reason>

    Examples:
      |reason         |
      |no username    |
      |no password    |
      |locked account |
      |invalid user   |
